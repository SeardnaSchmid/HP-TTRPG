# HP-TTRPG

A Harry Potter-inspired tabletop RPG where players are outsiders discovering the magical world for the first time - think "misfits and magic."

## What Makes This Game Special

- **Start as Complete Novices**: Players begin with no magical knowledge
- **Learn Through Play**: Spells and magical skills are earned through gameplay
- **Stress Matters**: Your emotional state affects your magical abilities
- **Mundane + Magic**: Characters can use both magical and non-magical solutions
- **School Setting**: Progress through a magical curriculum with other students

## Quick Start

1. **Character Creation**: Choose background, assign attributes (1-5), select mundane skills
2. **Basic Resolution**: Roll d20 + Attribute + Skill vs. Difficulty Number
3. **Magic Learning**: Attend classes and complete challenges to unlock spells
4. **Stress System**: High stress makes magic harder; success reduces stress
