# Harry Potter Tabletop RPG

Welcome to a magical world of adventure! This tabletop role-playing game lets you experience the wonder and excitement of the wizarding world through the eyes of new students discovering magic for the first time.

## What is This Game?

This Harry Potter TTRPG is inspired by the "misfits and magic" concept - you play as ordinary people who suddenly receive mysterious letters inviting them to a magical school.
