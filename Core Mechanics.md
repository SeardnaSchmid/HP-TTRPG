# Core Mechanics

## Basic Resolution System

All actions in the Harry Potter TTRPG use a unified d20 system:

**Basic Roll**: 1d20 + Attribute + Skill + Modifiers vs. Target Number

### Difficulty Classes
- **Simple (DC 8)**: Routine tasks that rarely fail
- **Easy (DC 10)**: Basic challenges with some risk
- **Moderate (DC 12)**: Standard difficulty for most tasks
- **Hard (DC 15)**: Challenging tasks requiring skill
- **Very Hard (DC 18)**: Expert-level challenges
- **Nearly Impossible (DC 20+)**: Legendary feats

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Discovery
Learning about the magical world, uncovering secrets, and solving mysteries. Uses Intelligence-based skills like Knowledge (Magical Theory), Investigation, and Perception.

### 2. Social
Navigating relationships with fellow students, professors, and magical creatures. Uses Charisma-based skills like Persuasion, Deception, and Animal Handling.

### 3. Magic
Casting spells, brewing potions, and channeling magical energy. Uses various attributes depending on the type of magic being performed.

## Stress and Wonder

Characters have two special tracks that reflect their emotional state:

### Stress (0-10)
- Increases from academic pressure, social conflicts, and dangerous situations
- High stress imposes penalties on spell casting and social interactions
- Reduced through rest, friendship, and positive experiences

### Wonder (0-10)
- Increases from discovering new magic, exploring hidden areas, and achieving goals
- High wonder provides bonuses to learning spells and making friends
- Naturally decreases over time as the magical becomes mundane

## Turn Structure

### Exploration Turns (10 minutes)
Used during investigation, study, and non-combat activities.

### Encounter Turns (1 minute)
Used during tense social situations, spell practice, and dangerous exploration.

### Combat Rounds (6 seconds)
Used during duels, creature encounters, and emergency situations.

## Actions Per Turn

On your turn, you can:
- **One Major Action**: Cast a spell, make an attack, use a complex skill
- **One Minor Action**: Move, draw an item, make a simple skill check
- **Any Number of Free Actions**: Speak, drop an item, simple gestures

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Some situations grant **Advantage** (roll twice, take higher) or **Disadvantage** (roll twice, take lower):

### Advantage Examples
- Using a spell you've mastered
- Acting with support from friends
- High Wonder (8+ points)

### Disadvantage Examples
- Attempting magic while stressed (8+ Stress)
- Acting against your character's nature
- Rushing without proper preparation

## Group Actions

Students often work together:
- **Helping**: Grant +2 bonus to another's roll
- **Combined Effort**: Multiple characters work on same task
- **Group Study**: Share learning and reduce individual Stress

## Learning and Growth

Characters advance through:
- **Experience Points**: Gained from sessions, achievements, and good roleplay
- **Spell Learning**: Acquired through classes, practice, and discovery
- **Relationship Building**: Developing bonds with NPCs and other characters
- **House Points**: Earned through exemplary behavior and achievements
