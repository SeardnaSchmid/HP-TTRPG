# Core Mechanics

## Overview
This Harry Potter TTRPG is designed around the "misfits and magic" concept - players are outsiders discovering the magical world for the first time. The game emphasizes learning, discovery, and growth as characters progress from complete novices to competent wizards.

## Basic Resolution System
All actions in the game use a **d20 + Attribute + Skill** system:
- Roll 1d20
- Add relevant Attribute (1-5 scale)
- Add relevant Skill (0-3 scale)
- Compare to Difficulty Number (DN)

### Difficulty Numbers
- **Simple (DN 8)**: Basic tasks most people can do
- **Moderate (DN 12)**: Requires some skill or luck
- **Hard (DN 16)**: Challenging even for skilled individuals
- **Heroic (DN 20)**: Extremely difficult, requires mastery

## Stress and Learning
Characters have a **Stress** level (0-10) that affects their performance:
- **Low Stress (0-3)**: +1 bonus to all rolls
- **Moderate Stress (4-6)**: No modifier
- **High Stress (7-9)**: -2 penalty to all rolls
- **Overwhelmed (10)**: Disadvantage on all rolls (roll twice, take lower)

Stress increases from:
- Failing spell attempts (+1)
- Dangerous situations (+1-3)
- Social pressure (+1)

Stress decreases from:
- Successful spell casting (-1)
- Rest and downtime (-2)
- Positive social interactions (-1)

## Magic and Mundane Balance
- **Mundane Skills**: Always available, represent pre-magical knowledge
- **Magical Skills**: Must be learned through gameplay, start at 0
- **Spell Failure**: When magic fails, characters can often fall back on mundane solutions

## Character Progression
Characters advance through:
1. **Skill Advancement**: Practice and successful use improves skills
2. **Spell Learning**: Attending classes and solving challenges unlocks new spells
3. **Attribute Growth**: Significant story milestones can improve attributes

## Turn Structure
1. **Initiative**: Roll 1d20 + Dexterity + Athletics
2. **Actions per Turn**: One primary action + movement
3. **Primary Actions**: Cast spell, use skill, attack, complex interaction
4. **Free Actions**: Simple movements, speaking, drawing items

## Collaborative Storytelling
The game encourages:
- Players describing how their characters approach problems
- GM presenting challenges that can be solved multiple ways
- Learning from both successes and failures
- Building relationships between characters and NPCs
