# Magic System

## Introduction

- Players begin with no spells and no magical knowledge.
- The adventure starts with each character receiving a mysterious letter inviting them to the magical school.
- The experience is inspired by 'misfits and magic'—players are outsiders discovering the magical world for the first time.

## Learning Spells

- Spells are learned through attending classes, practicing, and solving quests.
- The school curriculum introduces basic spells gradually as players progress.
- Spell learning is tracked via a skill tree, with branches for different magical disciplines (e.g., Charms, Transfiguration, Potions).

## Spellcasting

- Casting a spell requires a skill check, influenced by the character's magical ability and current stress level.
- Novices may fail or cause magical mishaps if their stress is high or they lack experience.

## Spell Progression

- As players gain experience, they unlock new spells and improve existing ones.
- Mastery of a branch grants access to advanced spells and magical techniques.

## School Curriculum

- Basic spells are introduced through lessons and story events:
  - Lumos (light)
  - Wingardium Leviosa (levitate)
  - Expelliarmus (disarm)
  - Protego (shield)
  - Reparo (repair)
- Advanced spells are unlocked through progression and special events.
