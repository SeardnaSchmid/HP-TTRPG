# Dice Mechanics

## Primary Die
The game uses a **d20** as the primary die for all resolution rolls.

## Basic Roll Formula
**d20 + Attribute + Skill vs. Difficulty Number (DN)**

### Example Roll
Attempting to unlock a door with magic:
- Roll: 1d20 (rolled 14)
- Intelligence: 3
- Charms skill: 1
- Total: 14 + 3 + 1 = 18
- Compare to DN 16 (Hard) = **Success!**

## Special Rolls

### Advantage/Disadvantage
- **Advantage**: Roll 2d20, take the higher result
  - Gained from: Good preparation, favorable conditions, low stress
- **Disadvantage**: Roll 2d20, take the lower result
  - Caused by: High stress (10), poor conditions, rushing

### Critical Results
- **Natural 20**: Exceptional success - spell works better than expected
- **Natural 1**: Complication - something unexpected happens (not necessarily failure)

## Opposed Rolls
When characters act against each other:
- Both roll d20 + Attribute + Skill
- Higher total wins
- Ties go to the defender/character maintaining status quo

## Group Rolls
For teamwork:
- Primary character makes the roll
- Each helper adds +2 to the roll (maximum +6 from helpers)
- All participants share consequences of failure

## Spell Mishaps (Natural 1 on Magic)
Roll 1d6 when you get a natural 1 on a magical skill check:
1. **Fizzle**: Nothing happens, lose the spell
2. **Weak Effect**: Spell works at half effectiveness
3. **Wrong Target**: Spell affects unintended target
4. **Overcharge**: Spell works but causes +1 Stress
5. **Wild Magic**: GM chooses interesting side effect
6. **Backfire**: Spell affects the caster instead
