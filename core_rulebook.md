# Core Rulebook

## Introduction & Setting
Welcome to a magical school where you're the outsider learning magic for the first time. This game captures the wonder, confusion, and growth of discovering a hidden magical world. You'll start as a complete novice and gradually learn spells, make friends, and navigate the challenges of magical education.

**Core Theme**: "Misfits and Magic" - You don't belong to the magical world initially, making every discovery meaningful and every failure a learning opportunity.

## Core Concepts
- **Primary Die**: d20 for all resolution rolls
- **Turn Structure**: Initiative-based, one primary action per turn
- **Actions per Turn**: Move + one primary action (cast spell, use skill, etc.)
- **Resolution**: d20 + Attribute + Skill vs. Difficulty Number (8/12/16/20)
- **Stress System**: Emotional state affects magical performance (0-10 scale)

## Character Creation
Characters begin as mundane individuals who've just received their acceptance letter:

1. **Choose Background**: Your pre-magical life and skills
2. **Assign Attributes**: 15 points among Str/Dex/Int/Wis/Cha (1-4 starting max)
3. **Select Mundane Skills**: 4 skills reflecting your background (2 at level 2, 2 at level 1)
4. **Starting Equipment**: Basic mundane items, no magical equipment yet
5. **Define Motivation and Fears**: What drives you, what worries you about magic

*All magical skills start at 0 and must be learned through gameplay.*

## Attributes & Skills
**Attributes (1-5)**: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma
**Mundane Skills (0-3)**: Athletics, Academics, Technology, Social, Stealth, Investigation, Medicine, Arts
**Magical Skills (0-3)**: Charms, Transfiguration, Potions, Defense Against Dark Arts, Herbology, Divination, Care of Magical Creatures

Skills advance through successful use, teaching, and dedicated study.

## Equipment & Inventory
- **Starting Equipment**: Mundane items from your background
- **Magical Equipment**: Earned through story progression
- **Spell Components**: Usually provided by the school
- **Personal Items**: Important for character connections to mundane world

## Combat System
Combat uses the same d20 + Attribute + Skill system:
1. **Initiative**: d20 + Dex + Athletics, highest goes first
2. **Actions**: Move + one primary action per turn
3. **Spellcasting**: Uses magical skills vs. appropriate difficulty
4. **Stress Impact**: High stress makes combat casting more difficult

*Combat emphasizes creative problem-solving over direct confrontation.*

## Magic/Powers System
Magic is learned progressively through:
- **Attending Classes**: Unlocks new spells and improves existing ones
- **Practice with Peers**: Social learning and skill development
- **Story Challenges**: Breakthrough moments that grant new abilities
- **Skill Trees**: Different magical disciplines with prerequisites

**Stress affects magic**: Low stress grants bonuses, high stress causes penalties and increases mishap chances.

**Spell Failure**: Can result in interesting complications rather than just "nothing happens."

## Advancement/Leveling
Characters advance through:
1. **Skill Advancement**: Successful use marks progress toward improvement
2. **Spell Learning**: New spells unlocked through classes and story events
3. **Attribute Growth**: Major story milestones can improve attributes
4. **Relationship Development**: Bonds with NPCs affect learning opportunities

*No traditional "levels" - advancement is organic and story-driven.*

## Game Master Guidelines
- **Encourage Experimentation**: Let players try creative solutions
- **Make Failure Interesting**: Mishaps should create new story opportunities
- **Balance Challenge**: Success should feel earned but not impossible
- **Emphasize Growth**: Show how characters change from their experiences
- **Manage Pacing**: Balance classroom time with adventure and social interaction

**Key Principles**:
- Magic should feel wondrous but not easy
- Every character should have moments to shine
- Relationships and personal growth are as important as magical power
- The mundane world remains relevant and valuable
