# Combat System

## Turn Order

Classic initiative: Each player rolls for initiative at the start of combat; highest goes first. Turn-based actions as in D&D.

## Actions

- On your turn, you may:
  - Move
  - Cast a spell
  - Use an item
  - Interact with the environment
- Novices start with basic spells from the school curriculum.
- Learning new spells is a major part of progression, represented by a large skill tree.
